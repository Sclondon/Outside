extends CharacterBody3D
## Character controller tuned for touch.
##
## Simulation runs in the physics step; the visible rig is detached and follows an
## interpolated position, so motion stays smooth on any refresh rate.
##
## Besides running, sprinting and jumping he can push blocks, sneak, slide out of a run,
## catch ledges, shimmy along and climb them, climb ropes, and pick things up
## and throw them. How he takes a landing depends on how hard he comes down.
