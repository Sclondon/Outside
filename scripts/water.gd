class_name Water
extends Node3D
## Water in a flat, painted style: a box of it, with this node in the middle of
## its surface. Matte colour that is clear where it is shallow and dark where it
## is deep, pale lines wandering over it, broken glints where it throws the sun
## at the eye, a ragged rim of foam round whatever breaks it, a gentle swell,
## a net of light on whatever lies under it, and a murk for a camera that goes
## under. Things that fall in splash; things that move in it leave rings.
##
## The ideas are those of the water in Salmon Run 2 (shaders/water.gdshader
## there): how much water there really is behind each pixel, read from the depth
## buffer, gives the colour, the clearness and the rim of foam; noise worked out
## in whole numbers, so that it has no seams; a swell that is a sum of trains of
## waves, which the script can work out too, to float things on; rings and wakes
## drawn by the water's own shader from a short list of points.
##
## It holds nothing in and floats nothing: it is only the look, and answers to
## "how deep is this point". Add one, set `size`, and call `watch` for whatever
## should splash.
