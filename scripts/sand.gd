class_name Sand
## Sand, and the one shader all of it is drawn with: the ground (`SandGround`),
## the piles under a `SandFall`, the lumps of a `SandBlob`, and any mesh a
## level gives `Sand.surface()` to.
##
## - Grain: every grain is a little lighter or darker than the next. There is
##   no texture; a grain is a cell of space, and its tone a number made from
##   where the cell is. Further off, where a grain would be smaller than a
##   pixel, bigger cells take over for a while and then the grain fades out
##   altogether, as real grain does: far sand is smooth.
## - Glitter: each grain is also a tiny mirror tipped its own way, and shows
##   only when it happens to throw the light straight at the eye.
## - Ripples: the small waves the wind leaves, lying across the wind, lit as
##   ridges, and bending to the lie of the land. They fade out before they
##   would be too fine to draw.
## - Kinds: fine pale drift sand; coarse, darker, pebbly sand; smooth slip
##   faces in the lee of a crest; and, where a `SandGround` has been painted,
##   damp dark sand and hard-packed paths. Which is where comes from broad
##   patches, from the slope and which way it faces the wind, and from paint.
## - Other ground, where it has been painted (`Kind`): white, red and black
##   sand, which are sand in every way but their colour and their glitter;
##   hard dirt, dull and mottled and cracked as dried mud is; and sandstone,
##   bare rock in bands of colour with a joint here and there. Each fades into
##   the next, and sand lies over the edge of the hard kinds in ragged drifts.
## - Snow: the same stuff seen cold. `snow_surface()`, a `SandGround` with
##   `snow` on, or `Kind.SNOW` painted: pale and blue in its hollows, with no
##   ripples and no kinds of grain, and (on a `SandGround`) prints that keep
##   the whole shape of the boot.
## - Light: the same hard cut between light and shadow as `Toon.surface` when
##   the menu's world shading is banded, and smooth when it is not.
##
## It is worked out from where a point is in the world, not from texture
## coordinates, so any mesh can wear it, and two that touch match.
##
## What looked stretched before this was the far grain: a pixel of distant
## ground covers a long thin strip of it, and grains (and glints) sized to the
## length of that strip came out as wide flat dashes on the screen. Grains are
## now sized by the strip's area, and fade as it gets longer and thinner.

const COLOUR := Color(0.83, 0.68, 0.45)
## Wet sand is darker, and shows fewer glints.
const WET := Color(0.66, 0.52, 0.33)

## The other colours sand comes in, hard ground, and snow (see `Kind`).
const WHITE := Color(0.87, 0.83, 0.73)
const RED := Color(0.72, 0.34, 0.19)
const BLACK := Color(0.15, 0.14, 0.145)

const SANDSTONE := Color(0.74, 0.55, 0.38)
const SNOW := Color(0.8, 0.85, 0.93)

## What may be painted on a `SandGround` (see `SandGround.paint`).
## - COARSE, DAMP, PACKED, PALE: sand as it was: pebbly; wet and dark; trodden
##   hard (shallow prints, and he hardly sinks); fine and light.
## - DIRT: hard dirt. It takes no prints, nobody sinks into it, and it does
##   not run on a slope. SANDSTONE: rock, the same and more so.
## - WHITE, RED, BLACK: sand of another colour, and sand in every other way.
## - SNOW: prints in it are crisp, and it does not run.
## (New ones go on the end: levels keep these as numbers.)

## much the sand should turn it back up, and `sky` the light of the sky (its colour
