extends MummyRig
## The brute's way of moving (`Mummy.Kind.BRUTE`, models/mummy_brute.glb).
##
## - It waddles. Its legs are short and set wide, so to take a step it has to
##   tip its whole weight over the other foot first: the barrel of it rolls
##   from side to side and swings round with each leg, and every foot comes
##   down flat and hard, which it sinks under and its head nods to.
## - Its arms are longer than its legs and hang like weights, knuckles near the
##   ground, swinging forward and back against its steps; after him they are
##   held out low and wide.
## - It strikes with one arm, swept round level at the height of his chest from
##   far out at its side (which goes over him if he is down); every third time
##   it brings both down from over its head instead.
